About the project


I am a Data Analyst / Business Analyst working for a new eCommerce company called A&B Co. (similar to Amazon) and I’ve been asked to prepare a presentation for the Vice President of Sales and the Vice President of Operations that summarizes sales and operations thus far. The summary should include (at a minimum) a summary of the current state of the business, current customer satisfaction, and a proposal of 2-3 areas where the company can improve.

Here are some facts:

● It’s currently September 2018

● The company’s inception was January 2017 

● The company is US-based but launched in Brazil 

● You can assume all orders are delivered 

As a Data Analyst, I am expected to look for contributing factors aside from the expected key points listed out, and find relationships between variables that constitute questions.
